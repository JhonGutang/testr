# Testr
Testr is a fast and efficient test runner for Visual Studio Code, designed to make running and managing tests simple and developer-friendly.
It allows you to run all tests or individual tests with a single click, while providing organized, easy-to-read test statistics that help you quickly understand test results. Currently, Testr supports **Jest** for JavaScript/TypeScript and **PHPUnit** for PHP (optimized for Laravel), with plans to add support for more frameworks in the future.
More than just a test adapter, Testr is a cross-language test orchestration platform, built to simplify multi-language development workflows and give developers a unified, streamlined test experience.
